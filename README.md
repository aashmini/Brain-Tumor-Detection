# Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning(MobileNetV2)

# Overview
This project uses AI-based image processing and deep learning to detect brain tumors from MRI scans. The model is trained to classify images into tumor or non-tumor categories, providing an efficient and automated diagnosis tool.

# Features
- Deep Learning Model for brain tumor classification
- User-friendly GUI for easy interaction
- High Accuracy achieved using CNN-based models
- Supports MRI Scan Images for tumor detection

# Dataset
The model is trained on publicly available MRI brain scan datasets containing labeled tumor and non-tumor images. Preprocessing includes:
* Image resizing to match MobileNetV2 input dimensions (224x224)
* Normalization to scale pixel values between 0 and 1
* Data augmentation to improve generalization

# Technology Stack
  - Python üêçTensorFlow / Keras for Deep Learning
  - OpenCV & PIL for Image Processing
  - Tkinter / PyQt for GUI
  - NumPy, Pandas for Data Handling

# Model Performance
The model has been trained on a large dataset, achieving:
- Accuracy: 94%+
